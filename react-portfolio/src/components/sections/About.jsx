                        I am a passionate <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> with a keen eye for <strong>UI/UX design</strong>.
                        My journey involves building responsive web applications using modern technologies like React, Angular, and
                        Python.
                        Beyond coding, I have a foundational understanding of cybersecurity, ensuring that the solutions I build are
                        not just beautiful, but secure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to tackle complex problems with clean, scalable
                        code.
